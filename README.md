## List of Jupyter notebook tutorial

* [Jupyter introduction](./notebooks/Jupyter_introdcution.ipynb)

Binder is cloud computing platform to deploy Jupyter notebooks. It is easy to use and share the notebooks. Here, we are using the Binder platform to delivery our tools and notebooks for courses. The configurations for Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are slightly different. Please check the link below:

Widgets are largely used for this projects. The ipywidgets package well supports to implement widgets in the Jupyter.

* [Use widget for the Jupyter](./notebooks/Use_widgets.ipynb)

Besides all the default widgets in the package, one can also create custom widgets.

* [A custom widget example](./notebooks/Custom_widget_example.ipynb)

By using the widgets, we can demonstrate scientific problems and knowledge. Here is a demo to show the sine function with widgets in Jupyter notebook.

* [Sine function with widget interact](./notebooks/Sine_function_a.ipynb)
* [Sine function with more advanced widgets](./notebooks/Sine_function_b.ipynb)

Voila package can render Jupyter notebooks in live with interactive widgets. Through using Voila with Binder, one can create webpage applications.
